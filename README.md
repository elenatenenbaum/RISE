# Remote infant studies of early learning (RISE): Scalable online replications of key findings in infant cognitive development.

This repo was created primarily to serve as a hub for data sharing and provide codes that were written to generate findings in our manuscript. 

## Data 

Folder "Data" contains the final data files (.csv) for all 7 tasks.

## R Code

Analysis codes are stored under "Code_analysis_RISE.Rmd" and can be opened in RStudio. The code is presented as a tutorial, thus it contains information on the required packages, task-by-task instruction regarding names of the outcome, covariate, and random effect variables, as well as the actual models. Code for the violin plot is also included.
